# Video special effects
This project is a tool that utilizes OpenCV and PyQt5, allowing users to import photos and apply four special effects (embossing, cartoon, sketch, and oil painting). Users can select their images through an intuitive PyQt5 GUI and choose from various effects to preview them in real time. The program provides a user-friendly interface that enables even non-professionals to easily perform photo editing tasks. Additionally, it includes functionality for saving the modified images, making it easy for users to share or store their results.
